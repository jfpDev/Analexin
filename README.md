# Analexin
This program is a lexical and syntactic analyzer. It takes JavaCode2Analize.txt coding file written in Java and executes the operation. 

An initial code was written by @charlead using the Jcup and Jflex packages to generate the *.java files.

Using the initial files I changed the algoritm to perform an analysis on the file, so it returns a lexical and syntactic result. 

Add the Jcup and the Jflex .jar packages and run the code.
